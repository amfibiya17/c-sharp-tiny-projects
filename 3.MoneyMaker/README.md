Money Maker
==============

## What is this project about

You have three types of coins:
- A bronze coin is worth 1 cent
- A silver coin is worth 5 cents
- A gold coin is worth 10 cents

What is the minimum number of coins that equals 98 cents?

It’s a hard question to answer in your head, but it’s a fun problem to solve with programming.  
In this project I used C# to build a Money Maker: a program in which a user enters an amount and gets the minimum number of coins that equal that value.

This project got me comfortable with C# division (/), rounding down (Math.Floor()), and modulo (%): I can find how many coins “fit” into an amount by dividing the amount by the coin value, rounding down, and finding the remainder.
